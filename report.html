  <h1>Project 2: Web Service | Report</h1>

  <p>Here's a general overview of the functionallity of this web service:
  </p>
  <p>Endpoints:
    <ul>
      <li>
	<b>GET		/photos</b> - returns ALL photos
      </li>
      <li>
	<b>GET		/photos/:month/:year</b> - returns photos for the given month (INT) and year (INT). 
			Entries are ordered by day.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b>GET		/photos/:month/:day/:year</b> - returns photos found on the given month (INT), day (INT), 
			and year (INT). Entries are ordered by year.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b>POST		/photos</b> - adds a word with the given identification options [POST must include the
			following identification options: year (INT), month (INT), day (INT), image name (TEXT),
			image source/link (TEXT), and the image description (TEXT)]
      </li>
      <li>
	<b>PATCH	/photos/:id</b> - updates a word with the given identification number (INT)
      </li>
      <li>

      </li>
      <li>
	<b>DELETE   	/photos/:id/:month/:day/:year</b> - removes a photo based on the given ID (INT), month (INT),
			day (INT), and year (INT). NOTE: This will HARD DELETE the photo.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>The following are a couple examples of using the endpoints with CURL and on the browser:
  </p>
  <p><i>NOTE: These examples all use the same image with the ID of 1. In order to GET, PATCH, DELETE, the image must
	  be present (add with POST).</i>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><b>GET</b> ALL: curl --location --request GET 'https://project2.bradfell.me:8443/photos'</p>

  <p>
    Below are listed goals and tasks for this project and how they were completed:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p><b>Your service will not manage a to-do list.</b></p>
      <p>This service is far from a to-do list. It's a media sharing and rating service, known as Ufotomi!</p>
      <p>Creators can share their creations by providing the source link (from external site at this point), a name, 
      as well as a description of their photo or other media form. This service has a specific focus to the creator 
      /"influencer" audience as a new platform for sharing media, but also to those who want to be entertained or 
      review creators material.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><b>You will store your app’s data long-term in an SQL-based relational database like MySQL. (Despite using 
	      a relational database, your database need not have multiple tables.)</b></p>
      <p>MySQL was installed and set-up for the service.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><b>You will provide an Express-based web service for interacting with the database.</b></p>
      <p>Express has been configured into this project from the beginning.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><b>Your web service will be available via https://project2.YOUR-DOMAIN-NAME:8443/.</b></p>
      <p>The web service is viewable through the suggested link: <a href="https://project2.bradfell.me:8443/">
	      https://project2.bradfell.me:8443/</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><b>The endpoints of the web service and any parameters must be appropriately named.</b></p>
      <p>The endpoints are named in relation to the project and follow common web service etiquette. See the full 
      list of endpoints at the top of this page.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><b>The web service must send and receive complex data as JSON.</b></p>
      <p>The web service suports the given prompt - sending and receiving Ufotomi media through JSON format.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><b>The full spectrum of CRUD operations must be supported.</b></p>
      <p>Ufotomi has the full support for CRUD operations - GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE. See the full list of 
      available endpoint at the top of this page.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><b>The database must only be directly accessible from within your droplet, and not from outside. Use ufw 
	      to block all ports but the ones you need for SSH and your allowed web servers.</b></p>
      <p>Outside clients are blocked with the Linux firewall: Uncomplicated Firewall (ufw). Traffic is allowed 
      through the ports Apache and Nginx listen to: 22, 80, 443, and 8443.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><b>You will create an Nginx server that allows global, encrypted access to your web service.</b></p>
      <p>Ufotomi was set-up with Nginx in mind and all traffic is redirected to encrypted access accordingly with 
      Nginx.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><b>The web service must support cross-origin resource sharing using custom middleware and an options wildcard 
	      endpoint.</b></p>
      <p>Ufotomi supports cross-origin resource sharing and an options wildcard endpoint.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><b>Your web service must be started using a process manager like pm2 so that it stays running.</b></p>
      <p>pm2 manages this project making sure it's consistently running.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><b>Your service must be stored in a Git repository that you have shared with your instructor. On GitHub, 
	      GitLab, and Bitbucket, share with the user twodee.</b></p>
      <p>The project is stored in the Git repository: <a href="https://github.com/Bronstrom/CS347-web-service">
	      Bronstrom/CS347-web-service</a> and added twodee (Chris Johnson) as a collaborator.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><b>Your database’s creation and schema scripts must be included in your repository. Passwords must not be 
	      included.</b></p>
      <p>The required database scripts are included in the provided repo. Credential passwords (credential.json) are 
      excluded as indicated by <i>.gitignore</i>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><b>Your Git repository should show a steady flow of commits over the course of the project. Committing and 
	      pushing should happen steadily, after each work session, and not just right before the due date.</b></p>
      <p>Commits have been spread out over the course of days, and not just before the due date.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><b>Have your service respond to https://project2.YOUR-DOMAIN-NAME:8443/report.html by sending back an HTML 
	      page with brief report containing an itemized breakdown of how you believe you have met the expectations listed above.</b></p>
      <p>If you're reading this on <a href="https://project2.bradfell.me:8443/report.html">
	      https://project2.bradfell.me:8443/report.html</a>, then this part works as intended.</p>
    </li>
