  <h1>Project 2: Web Service | Report</h1>

  <!-- CHANGE photo to something like foto or media instead -->

  <p>Here's a general overview of using this web service:
  </p>
  <p>Endpoints:
    <ul>
      <li>
	GET   /photos/:month/:day - returns photos found on the given month and day. Entries are ordered by year
      </li>
      <li>
	POST   /photos - adds a word with the given identification options (year, month, day, image name, image source/link, and the image description
      </li>
      <li>
	DELETE   /photos/:id - removes a photo based on the given ID (HARD DELETE)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

    Below are listed goals and tasks for this project and how they were completed:

      <b>Your service will not manage a to-do list.</b>
      This service is far from a to-do list. It's a media sharing and rating service, known as Ufotomi!

      Creators can share their creations by providing the source link (from external site at this point), a name, as well as a description of their photo or other media form. From here, users can rate them on an Awesome, Nice, Meh, and Boo scale. This service has a specific focus to the creator /"influencer" audience as a new platform for sharing media, but also to those who want to be entertained or review creators material.

      <b>You will store your app’s data long-term in an SQL-based relational database like MySQL. (Despite using a relational database, your database need not have multiple tables.)</b>
      MySQL was installed and set-up for the service.
